### Overview:
- **Graph Construction**: The script constructs a graph using an edge list from a dataset of Facebook pages.
- **Graph Analysis**: Various graph metrics are calculated, such as the total number of edges, nodes, and average degree.
- **Link Prediction**: The script appears to prepare the data for link prediction by building an adjacency matrix and performing various operations on the graph.

### Key Libraries:
- `pandas`, `numpy`: For data manipulation and numerical operations.
- `networkx`: For creating and analyzing complex networks.
- `sklearn`: For machine learning metrics like ROC-AUC score.

# Network Analysis and Link Prediction

This Python script performs network analysis and link prediction on a graph constructed from an edge list dataset, specifically the `fb-pages-food.edges` dataset.

## Features

- **Graph Construction**: Reads an edge list and constructs an undirected graph.
- **Graph Metrics**: Calculates important metrics such as the number of edges, nodes, and average degree.
- **Link Prediction Preparation**: Prepares the graph for link prediction tasks, including adjacency matrix creation.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `networkx`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tqdm`

Install the required libraries using:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy networkx scikit-learn tqdm
```
### Execution 
```bash
python arsim.py
```
## Usage

1. **Load Data**: The script loads the edge list data from the file `fb-pages-food.edges` locates inside data folder.
2. **Graph Construction**: It constructs the graph using the edge list and calculates various graph metrics.
3. **Link Prediction Preparation**: Prepares the graph's adjacency matrix and other structures needed for link prediction.
